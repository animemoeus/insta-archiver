# GitHub Copilot Project Instructions

## What We Are Building:

We are building a instagram archiver project using the Neo Brutalism design system, which embraces bold, vibrant, and minimalistic aesthetics. Our goal is to create a visually striking and user-friendly web application that adheres to the Neo Brutalist principles of:

- High contrast color schemes
- Minimalist layouts
- Thick borders and shadows for depth
- Bold typography

## Objectives:

1. Follow the Neo Brutalism design philosophy using the available general component.
2. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness across devices.
3. Focus on simplicity and minimalism while maintaining a unique visual identity.

## Guidelines for the LLM:

- Suggest designs, features, or code that aligns with the Neo Brutalism aesthetic.
- Prioritize bold and vibrant styles with high contrast.
- Recommend or generate code snippets that demonstrate simplicity, clarity, and adherence to the design principles.
- Avoid overly complex or subtle designs that do not align with the Neo Brutalism aesthetic.

## Key Technologies:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or relevant frameworks).

## Additional Notes:

- The LLM should act as a creative collaborator to brainstorm ideas or generate code snippets.
- Always ensure designs are accessible, e.g., contrast meets WCAG compliance.
